**Course Description**

During this class, we will come up with individual or group project ideas to display at the final showcase. Moreover, we will learn how to manage our time, budget and materials for a successful installation. 

**Expectations & Goals**

  * You will participate in the showcase in some form. You don't have to contribute an individual work for the final showcase! Contributing to group or class projects is expected and group projects are part of our showcases. 
  * You should let Lauren or April know if you have any questions, doubts or concerns about your project. This is expected and we are here to help. 
  * The tools and equipment that belong to SFPC are available for your use, only AFTER you check in with Lauren before using them. We have a limited supply of monitors, projectors & computers and can't guarantee availability to everyone.
  * You will come up with a ton of ideas, iterate on a few and share at least one of them with the community.
